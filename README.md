# Reorganized Project

This project includes various scripts for different tasks such as training models, preprocessing data, and running tests. The scripts have been organized into different directories based on their functionality.

## Directory Structure

### models/training
- `train_model.py`: Script for training models. This script includes the logic for training machine learning models using the provided dataset.

### scripts
- `organize_scripts.py`: Script to organize project scripts. This script helps in categorizing and moving scripts to their respective directories.
- `verify_directories.py`: Utility script to verify the existence and structure of directories.
- `find_duplicates.py`: Script to find and handle duplicate files within the project.
- `check_features.py`: Script to check and validate features in the dataset.
- `vqa_model.py`: Visual Question Answering (VQA) model script. This script includes the implementation of the VQA model.
- `preprocess_data.py`: Script for data preprocessing. This script handles data cleaning, normalization, and preparation.
- `evaluate_model.py`: Script to evaluate models. This script includes the logic for evaluating the performance of trained models.

### tests
- `test_vqa_model.py`: Unit tests for the VQA model. This script includes test cases to ensure the VQA model works as expected.
